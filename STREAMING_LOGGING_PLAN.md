"""
Streaming Response Logging Implementation Plan:

The issue is that streaming responses aren't being logged because:
1. No httpx.Response object exists for streaming - it's Server-Sent Events
2. The response is built incrementally through multiple events  
3. Current logging only handles complete HTTP responses

Solution:
1. Create a StreamingResponseCollector class to accumulate streaming data
2. Add logging calls at all [DONE] markers in the streaming generators
3. Reconstruct the complete response for logging when stream finishes

This will capture:
- Final complete streaming response 
- Total tokens/usage from last chunk
- Response time from request start to [DONE]
- Any errors that occurred during streaming
