reasoning_46 = """1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants me to solve the arithmetic expression "12 * 15 + 8 * 3". The key phrase is "Solve step by step". This means I can't just give the final answer. I need to show my work and explain each step clearly.

2.  **Identify the Operations:** The expression has two multiplication operations and one addition operation:
    *   12 * 15
    *   8 * 3
    *   The results of these two multiplications are then added together.

3.  **Recall the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):**
    *   **P**arentheses / **B**rackets
    *   **E**xponents / **O**rders
    *   **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
    *   **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

4.  **Apply the Order of Operations to the Problem:**
    *   The expression is `12 * 15 + 8 * 3`.
    *   There are no parentheses or exponents.
    *   The next level is multiplication. There are two multiplication operations: `12 * 15` and `8 * 3`. According to PEMDAS, I must do these *before* the addition. I can do them in any order since they are separate parts of the expression.

5.  **Step 1: Solve the first multiplication (12 * 15).**
    *   I can do this in my head or by writing it out. Let's write it out to be clear for the user.
    *   Method 1: Standard multiplication.
        ```
          15
        x 12
        ----
         30  (2 * 15)
        +150  (10 * 15)
        ----
         180
        ```
    *   Method 2: Break it down (distributive property).
        *   12 * 15 = 12 * (10 + 5) = (12 * 10) + (12 * 5) = 120 + 60 = 180.
    *   Both methods give the same result: 180. I'll use the breakdown method in the explanation as it's often easier for people to follow.

6.  **Step 2: Solve the second multiplication (8 * 3).**
    *   This one is simpler.
    *   8 * 3 = 24.

7.  **Step 3: Perform the addition.**
    *   Now I substitute the results of the multiplications back into the original expression.
    *   Original: `12 * 15 + 8 * 3`
    *   Becomes: `180 + 24`
    *   Now, I need to add these two numbers.
        ```
          180
        +  24
        -----
         204
        ```
    *   Units column: 0 + 4 = 4.
    *   Tens column: 8 + 2 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.
    *   Hundreds column: 1 + (the carried-over 1) = 2.
    *   The result is 204.

8.  **Structure the Final Answer:**
    *   Start with a clear statement of the problem.
    *   Use headings or numbered steps to make it easy to follow. "Step 1", "Step 2", etc.
    *   Explain the order of operations (PEMDAS) as the guiding principle. This adds educational value.
    *   Show the calculation for each step clearly.
    *   First, calculate `12 * 15`. Show the breakdown (12 * 10 + 12 * 5).
    *   Second, calculate `8 * 3`.
    *   Third, add the two results together. Show the column addition or a simple sum.
    *   End with a clear, final answer statement.

9.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Step 1: "First, we need to solve the multiplication parts of the problem, according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)." - Good, explains the 'why'.
    *   "Calculate 12 * 15:" - Clear heading.
    *   `12 * 15 = 180` - Correct. I'll add the breakdown: `12 * 10 = 120` and `12 * 5 = 60`, then `120 + 60 = 180`. This is more "step-by-step".
    *   "Calculate 8 * 3:" - Clear heading.
    *   `8 * 3 = 24` - Correct.
    *   "Now, add the results together:" - Clear transition.
    *   `180 + 24 = 204` - Correct.
    *   Final Answer: "So, 12 * 15 + 8 * 3 = 204." - Perfect summary."""

reasoning_45v = """Got it, let's see. I need to solve 12 times 15 plus 8 times 3. First, I remember that in math, multiplication comes before addition, so I should do the two multiplication problems first, then add the results.

First multiplication: 12 * 15. I can break this down: 12 * 10 = 120, and 12 * 5 = 60. So 120 + 60 = 180.

Second multiplication: 8 * 3 = 24.

Now add the two results: 180 + 24 = 204.

So the final answer is 204."""
