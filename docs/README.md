## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` for technical documentation
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Place in appropriate subdirectory based on content type

### Content Organization
- **Core docs** (README, CHANGELOG, AGENTS) stay in root
- **API docs** in `/docs/` root level
- **Development** docs in `/docs/development/`
- **Performance** docs in `/docs/performance/`
- **Architecture** docs in `/docs/architecture/`

### Special Files

#### AGENTS.md - Critical for AI Development
The `AGENTS.md` file **must remain in the root directory** as it provides essential context for AI agents working on this project. It contains:
- Project architecture overview
- Critical development rules (Docker Compose usage)
- Environment configuration guidelines
- Testing requirements and patterns
- Recent changes and bug fixes

This file serves as a "constitution" for AI agents to ensure consistent, proper development practices.
