# Context Info for All Endpoints - No Text Management

## Summary

Successfully implemented the requested changes:
1. **Removed context management logic entirely for text requests** - no validation, truncation, or context overflow handling
2. **Added context_info to ALL endpoints** - both text and vision endpoints now provide context information for client awareness

## Key Changes

### 1. Context Validation Removal for Text Requests
**File: `main.py` - Line ~1582**

**Before:**
```python
if use_openai_endpoint:  # All OpenAI endpoint requests got context validation
    context_info = get_context_info(anth_messages, use_openai_endpoint)
    # ... validation logic
```

**After:**
```python
if use_openai_endpoint and has_images:  # Only vision requests get validation
    context_info = get_context_info(anth_messages, use_openai_endpoint)  
    # ... validation logic
else:
    # Text requests (both Anthropic and OpenAI) - no validation needed
    processed_messages = anth_messages
    truncation_metadata = {"truncated": False}
```

### 2. Context Info for All Endpoints
**File: `main.py` - `_add_context_limit_info()` function**

**Before:**
- Vision requests: Full context_info object
- Text requests: Only endpoint_type in usage section

**After:**
- **ALL requests**: Full context_info object with real token counts, limits, utilization
- **ALL requests**: Enhanced usage section with context information

## New Behavior

### Text Requests (Both Anthropic & OpenAI Endpoints)
✅ **No context management/validation applied**
- No `get_context_info()` calls
- No `validate_and_truncate_context()` calls  
- No emergency truncation logic
- **BUT** full `context_info` object provided for client awareness

### Vision Requests (OpenAI Endpoint Only)
✅ **Full context management still applied**
- Context validation with `get_context_info()`
- Emergency truncation when needed with `validate_and_truncate_context()`
- Complete context management as before

### All Requests Get Context Info
✅ **Comprehensive context information**
```json
{
  "context_info": {
    "real_input_tokens": 7,
    "context_hard_limit": 200000,
    "endpoint_type": "anthropic",
    "utilization_percent": 0.0,
    "available_tokens": 127993,
    "truncated": false,
    "note": "Context information for client awareness"
  },
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 7,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 20,
    "real_input_tokens": 7,
    "context_limit": 200000,
    "context_utilization": "0.0%",
    "endpoint_type": "anthropic"
  }
}
```

## Test Results

```
🧪 Context Info for All Endpoints Test
==================================================

📝 Text auto-routing (Anthropic): ✅ PASS
   📊 Endpoint: anthropic ✅
   🧠 Has context_info: True ✅
   📋 Hard limit: 200000, Real tokens: 7, Utilization: 0.0%

📝 Text forced OpenAI: ✅ PASS  
   📊 Endpoint: openai ✅
   🧠 Has context_info: True ✅
   📋 Hard limit: 65536, Real tokens: 9, Utilization: 0.0%

📝 Text forced Anthropic: ✅ PASS
   📊 Endpoint: anthropic ✅
   🧠 Has context_info: True ✅
   📋 Hard limit: 200000, Real tokens: 7, Utilization: 0.0%

🏆 Overall Result: ✅ SUCCESS
🎉 New context behavior is working correctly!
   • ALL endpoints return context_info for client awareness  
   • Text requests get NO validation/truncation (scale properly)
   • Context info helps clients understand token usage on all endpoints
```

## Log Evidence

**Text requests now skip validation entirely:**
- No "Context analysis" log messages for text requests
- No "Context window OK" messages for text requests  
- Only "About to scale tokens" showing scaling still works
- Context info added to usage: `'real_input_tokens': 7, 'context_limit': 200000`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Overhead**: Text requests avoid all context validation/truncation logic
2. **Proper Scaling**: Text endpoints continue to scale tokens correctly without interference
3. **Universal Context Awareness**: ALL endpoints provide context information for client planning
4. **Targeted Management**: Only vision requests get context validation where it's actually needed
5. **Enhanced Usage Info**: All responses include comprehensive token and context information

## Rationale

This implementation addresses the core insight that text endpoints already scale tokens properly and don't need validation/truncation logic, while still providing clients with the context information they need to understand token usage and plan their requests accordingly.

The approach separates concerns:
- **Token scaling**: Continues to work properly for all endpoints
- **Context validation**: Only applied where needed (vision requests)  
- **Context awareness**: Provided universally for client benefit
